          Being inside my head is like being in a neverending dance - And I'm not talking about one of those fun wedding dances like the Cupid Shuffle or the Cha-Cha Slide. This is a continuous four-square dance with your most trusted ally and your subtle adversary...
        </p>
        <p>
          In the quiet expanse of isolation, I find solitude and insight; however, once I have found this place in my mind, a shadowy partner steps in from just off the dancefloor and tempts me to further isolate and withhold. A delicate balance between solace and sharing my thoughts with the world is created.
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome to my dance, now bow to your partner and do-si-do.
